I'm Ayodeji, a skilled data analyst with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of numbers. I teach data analysis using Tableau, which I adore, and I'm also proficient in Microsoft Excel and SQL.

My innovative approach earned me the "Out of the Box Thinker" award in the DataDNA March 2023 challenge on LinkedIn. With a background in chemical engineering, I bridge the gap between technical and analytical expertise.

I've created two engaging Tableau courses on BFI Insights' website, where learners can benefit from my data wizardry. I stand out in the world of data by sharing my knowledge and transforming complex data into understandable insights.

Currently a Tableau Social Ambassador 2024
